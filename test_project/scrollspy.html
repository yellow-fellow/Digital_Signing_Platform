                        Hello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other "longest
                        texts ever" on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! This is going to be a
                        WORLD RECORD! This is actually my third attempt at doing this. The first time, I didn't save it.
                        The second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it
                        into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid
                        crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not
                        the longest, but still pretty long. I hope this one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk
                        about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans
                        Go episode called "Waffles" where the word "Waffles" is said a hundred-something times. It's
                        pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig
                        Latin is? It's a language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel, move them to
                        the end, and add '-ay' to the end. If the word begins with a vowel, you just add '-way' to the
                        end. For example, "Waffles" becomes "Afflesway". I've been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the
                        fourth grade, so it surprised me when I saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin
                        with my sister sometimes. It's pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around
                        us gets confused. That's never actually happened before, but if it ever does, 'twill be pretty
                        funny. By the way, "'twill" is a word I invented recently, and it's a contraction of "it will".
                        I really hope it gains popularity in the near future, because "'twill" is WAY more fun than
                        saying "it'll". "It'll" is too boring. Nobody likes boring. This is nowhere near being the
                        longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing this a decade later, who
                        knows? But right now, it's not very long. But I'll just keep writing until it is the longest!
                        Have you ever heard the song "Dau Dau" by Awesome Scampis? It's an amazing song. Look it up on
                        YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister! It drives her crazy, and I love it.
                        Another way I like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She
                        hates the languages I make! The only language that we both speak besides English is Pig Latin. I
                        think you already knew that. Whatever. I think I'm gonna go for now. Bye! Hi, I'm back now. I'm
                        gonna contribute more to this soon-to-be giant wall of text. I just realised I have a giant
                        stuffed frog on my bed. I forgot his name. I'm pretty sure it was something stupid though. I
                        think it was "FROG" in Morse Code or something. Morse Code is cool. I know a bit of it, but I'm
                        not very good at it. I'm also not very good at French. I barely know anything in French, and my
                        pronunciation probably sucks. But I'm learning it, at least. I'm also learning Esperanto. It's
                        this language that was made up by some guy a long time ago to be the "universal language". A lot
                        of people speak it. I am such a language nerd. Half of this text is probably gonna be about
                        languages. But hey, as long as it's long! Ha, get it? As LONG as it's LONG? I'm so funny, right?
                        No, I'm not. I should probably get some sleep. Goodnight! Hello, I'm back again. I basically
                        have only two interests nowadays: languages and furries. What? Oh, sorry, I thought you knew I
                        was a furry. Haha, oops. Anyway, yeah, I'm a furry, but since I'm a young furry, I can't really
                        do as much as I would like to do in the fandom. When I'm older, I would like to have a fursuit,
                        go to furry conventions, all that stuff. But for now I can only dream of that. Sorry you had to
                        deal with me talking about furries, but I'm honestly very desperate for this to be the longest
                        text ever. Last night I was watching nothing but fursuit unboxings. I think I need help. This
                        one time, me and my mom were going to go to a furry Christmas party, but we didn't end up going
                        because of the fact that there was alcohol on the premises, and that she didn't wanna have to be
                        a mom dragging her son through a crowd of furries. Both of those reasons were understandable.
                        Okay, hopefully I won't have to talk about furries anymore. I don't care if you're a furry
                        reading this right now, I just don't wanna have to torture everyone else. I will no longer say
                        the F word throughout the rest of this entire text. Of course, by the F word, I mean the one
                        that I just used six times, not the one that you're probably thinking of which I have not used
                        throughout this entire text. I just realised that next year will be 2020. That's crazy! It just
                        feels so futuristic! It's also crazy that the 2010s decade is almost over. That decade brought
                        be a lot of memories. In fact, it brought be almost all of my memories. It'll be sad to see it
                        go. I'm gonna work on a series of video lessons for Toki Pona. I'll expain what Toki Pona is
                        after I come back. Bye! I'm back now, and I decided not to do it on Toki Pona, since many other
                        people have done Toki Pona video lessons already. I decided to do it on Viesa, my English code.
                        Now, I shall explain what Toki Pona is. Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language that has
                        only ~120 words! That means you can learn it very quickly. I reccomend you learn it! It's pretty
                        fun and easy! Anyway, yeah, I might finish my video about Viesa later. But for now, I'm gonna
                        add more to this giant wall of text, because I want it to be the longest! It would be pretty
                        cool to have a world record for the longest text ever. Not sure how famous I'll get from it, but
                        it'll be cool nonetheless. Nonetheless. That's an interesting word. It's a combination of three
                        entire words. That's pretty neat. Also, remember when I said that I said the F word six times
                        throughout this text? I actually messed up there. I actually said it ten times (including the
                        plural form). I'm such a liar! I struggled to spell the word "liar" there. I tried spelling it
                        "lyer", then "lier". Then I remembered that it's "liar". At least I'm better at spelling than my
                        sister. She's younger than me, so I guess it's understandable. "Understandable" is a pretty long
                        word. Hey, I wonder what the most common word I've used so far in this text is. I checked, and
                        appearantly it's "I", with 59 uses! The word "I" makes up 5% of the words this text! I would've
                        thought "the" would be the most common, but "the" is only the second most used word, with 43
                        uses. "It" is the third most common, followed by "a" and "to". Congrats to those five words! If
                        you're wondering what the least common word is, well, it's actually a tie between a bunch of
                        words that are only used once, and I don't wanna have to list them all here. Remember when I
                        talked about waffles near the beginning of this text? Well, I just put some waffles in the
                        toaster, and I got reminded of the very beginnings of this longest text ever. Okay, that was
                        lite
